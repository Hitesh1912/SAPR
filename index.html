Sina Finance, a widely used Chinese financial website has been selected as an experimental platform where a corpus of financial review data were collected. The intent is to obtain insights on how forecasting accuracy varies across alternative tools under different levels of volatility, providing evidence of how investment decisions might be made under differing conditions.</p>

		  <h4 align="justify">The Internet provides the opportunity for investors to post online opinions that they share with fellow investors. Sentiment analysis of online opinion posts can facilitate both investors’ investment decision making and stock companies’ risk perception. This paper develops a novel sentiment ontology to conduct context-sensitive sentiment analysis of online opinion posts in stock markets. The methodology integrates popular sentiment analysis into machine learning approaches based on support vector machine and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity modeling. A typical financial website called Sina Finance has been selected as an experimental platform where a corpus of financial review data was collected. Empirical results suggest solid correlations between stock price volatility trends and stock forum sentiment. Computational results show that the statistical machine learning approach has a higher classification accuracy than that of the semantic approach. Results also imply that investor sentiment has a particularly strong effect for value stocks relative to growth stocks.</h4>

			<p align="justify" class="style3">INVESTORS have often found it very costly to acquire useful information to assist them in investment decision making. For example, many investors have devoted a great deal of time to read messages posted on internet stock message boards to estimate asset prices based on information of varying quality. It has been reported that these message boards can have a significant impact on financial markets. Efficient investment decision making today is based on a variety of information sources including historical financial data series and messages posted on stock message boards. There have been a number of studies showing that the sentiment contained in these messages has been correlated with stock prices. This idea has been supported in Eastern Europe, Germany [3], and in China. There is also casestudy work on systemic risk occurred in banks and financial institutions using data from online, financial, and business-related discussion. However, it is not clear how this sentiment information can be used to make beneficial investment decisions.</p>
